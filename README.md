# Jarvis-A.I Prototype

Jarvis-A.I Prototype is an open-source artificial intelligence assistant project designed to serve as a flexible framework for building conversational agents, automating tasks, and integrating with external services. Inspired by sci-fi AI assistants, this project aims to provide developers with a starting point for intelligent automation, natural language understanding, and streamlined workflows.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Chat-based AI assistant capable of understanding and responding to natural language.
- **Task Automation**: Integrate with scripts, APIs, and third-party services to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Extensible Plugins**: Easily add new capabilities via custom modules or plugins.
- **Speech Recognition and Synthesis**: Optional voice interaction support.
- **User Personalization**: Save user preferences and context for tailored responses.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed to run on multiple operating systems.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubhankarVYEP/Jarvis-A.I-Prototype.git
   cd Jarvis-A.I-Prototype
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> **Note:** Requires Python 3.8+. Additional setup for voice modules may be required.
